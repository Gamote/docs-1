Referential integrity is a property of a set of data that states that all its references are valid. It requires that if one record references another, then the referenced record must exist. For example, if a `Post` model defines an author, then the author must also exist. Referential integrity is enforced through constraints that prevent you making changes that break references, and through defining [referential actions](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/referential-actions) that run when updating or deleting records. In the case of the `Post` model, for example, you will need to define what happens if its author is deleted.

In Prisma, referential integrity is implemented by defining relations between records using the [`@relation`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#relation) attribute. The `onUpdate` and `onDelete` arguments of this attribute can be used to define which referential action take place on updating or deleting the related record.

For example, take the following blog post schema, with a one-to-many relation between `Post`s and `User`s:

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=4;normal
model Post {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  author   User   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  authorId Int
}

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}
```

In this case, the `onDelete: Cascade` argument specifies the `Cascade` referential action, deleting the post if the related user is deleted. See [Referential actions](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/referential-actions) for further details of supported actions.

When connecting to relational databases that support foreign keys, referential integrity can be handled in the underlying database. This is the default option in Prisma when using SQL databases.

Alternatively, Prisma can emulate referential integrity in the client. This is the default option when using MongoDB as a database, because it does not support foreign keys. It can also be selected for relational databases in cases where foreign keys are not supported, or where it preferred for other reasons (for example, in cases where there are scaling concerns).

<Admonition type="warning">
  Be aware that currently Prisma only implements the referential actions when
  emulating referential integrity in the client, and not the constraints. If you
  set the referential actions to `NoAction` there will be no checks to prevent
  you from breaking the referential integrity.

<Admonition type="warning">
  There are significant performance implications to emulating referential
  integrity in the Prisma client. In cases where the underlying database can
  handle referential integrity with foreign keys, it is usually the preferred
  choice.

## Setting the referential integrity in the datasource

Referential integrity is currently a Preview feature. To enable this, add it to the `previewFeatures` list in the `generator` block of `schema.prisma`:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider             = "mysql"
  url                  = env("DATABASE_URL")
  referentialIntegrity = "prisma"
}

generator js {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["referentialIntegrity"]
}
```

To change the type of referential integrity used, update the `referentialIntegrity` parameter in the [`datasource`](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#datasource) block. The available options are:

- `foreignKeys`: this handles referential integrity in the database using foreign keys. This is the default option when using all SQL database connectors.
- `prisma`: this emulates referential integrity in the Prisma client. This is the default (and only available) option when using the MongoDB connector.

<Admonition type="warning">
  When using Prisma Migrate, setting the value to `prisma` will remove all
  previously created foreign keys in the next migration. Setting the value to
  `foreignKeys` will create foreign keys for all relations in the next
  migration.
</Admonition>

## Handling the referential integrity in Prisma

In the case where referential integrity is emulated in the Prisma client using the `prisma` option for the `referentialIntegrity` parameter, there is currently a reduced number of supported [referential actions](/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/referential-actions) available in the data model:

| Referential action | `onUpdate` | `onDelete` |
| :----------------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| Restrict           | no         | yes        |
| SetNull            | no         | yes        |
| SetDefault         | no         | no         |
| Cascade            | no         | yes        |
| NoAction           | no         | yes        |

In this case, any [`raw`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/raw-database-access) database queries will not trigger any of the actions, and they should be handled manually if deleting or updating records using the [`raw`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/raw-database-access) queries.

When using the `db pull` command, existing relations are kept in the data model. This has some caveats:

- When a model in the database is deleted, the relation on the other side gets deleted, if existing.
- When a scalar field used in a relation field gets deleted or renamed, the relation field is kept as-is, leading to validation errors. The user must fix the relation before continuing to use the data model in this case.

## Handling the referential integrity with foreign keys

In the case where referential integrity is handled in the database using the `foreignKeys` option for the `referentialIntegrity` parameter, all referential actions supported by the database are available:

| action      | `onUpdate` | `onDelete` |
| :---------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| Restrict⟒   | yes        | yes        |
| SetNull     | yes        | yes        |
| SetDefault⟑ | yes        | yes        |
| Cascade     | yes        | yes        |
| NoAction    | yes        | yes        |

- ⟒ Not supported on SQL Server
- ⟑ Not supported on MySQL/InnoDB

In this mode the [`raw`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/raw-database-access) database queries will trigger actions accordingly.
